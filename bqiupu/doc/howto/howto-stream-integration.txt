How to integrate new compoment to BPC stream

0. Overview:
   BPC stream presents stream for compoment such as App, Book, Music, PhotoAlbum, etc. To integrate the stream of a component, there are serveral steps:
   a. Generate a share stream from local compoment application and send to remote Server via a JSON.
   b. Present the necessary info by the 'attachments' section within the JSON.
   c. Provide the document about the 'attachments' for BPC.
   d. Provide a call back activity fro BPC when trying open the attachment.
   e. To show the stream shared from the component, invoke BPC actvity.

1. Generate a share stream
   The first step is generate a valid stream presenting as JSON, and succeed to send to the server, which mean you need to follow the server specific. Refer to server guide.
   Take Book stream for example, it will gernate a stream JSON looks like this:
{
  "post_id" : 2767425550397000477,
  "source" : 235,
  "created_time" : 1319611334990,
  "updated_time" : 1319611334990,
  "quote" : 0,
  "root" : 0,
  "mentions" : "",
  "app" : 2,
  "type" : 16,
  "app_data" : {
    "appData" : ""
  },
  "message" : "我推荐书:《2012玛雅末日预言》",
  "device" : "mfld_pr2 (intel; x86; generic) REL/Android-2.3.4/10",
  "can_comment" : true,
  "can_like" : true,
  "attachments" : [ {
    "id" : "0__-121231671643791757775322138788910443927__235__",
    "summary" : "2012玛雅末日预言",
    "coverurl" : "http://122.200.68.253:8980/brookserver/cover.borqs?name=2012%E7%8E%9B%E9%9B%85%E6%9C%AB%E6%97%A5%E9%A2%84%E8%A8%80&ownerid=235&md5=-121231671643791757775322138788910443927",
    "name" : "2012玛雅末日预言"
  } ],
  "destroyed_time" : 0,
  "target" : "",
  "from" : {
    "user_id" : 235,
    "display_name" : "赵非",
    "image_url" : "http://api.borqs.com/profile_image/profile_235_1316762154058_M.jpg",
    "address" : [ ]
  },
  "to" : [ ],
  "likes" : {
  },
  "comments" : {
  },
  "root_id" : "",
  "custom" : [ ],
  "iliked" : false
}

2. The 'attachments' JSON in the stream
   Except for those plain text stream, most comonent includes extra specific info within its stream. All such info MUST present within the 'attachments' section within the generated JSON.
   As to Book, see to above sample, all item about a sharing book are wrapped within 'attachments': the ebook file format (epub), file size (100605), etc. Again, the 'attachements' of the shared book in above example:
   "attachments" : [ {
    "id" : "0__-121231671643791757775322138788910443927__235__",
    "summary" : "2012玛雅末日预言",
    "coverurl" : "http://122.200.68.253:8980/brookserver/cover.borqs?name=2012%E7%8E%9B%E9%9B%85%E6%9C%AB%E6%97%A5%E9%A2%84%E8%A8%80&ownerid=235&md5=-121231671643791757775322138788910443927",
    "name" : "2012玛雅末日预言"
  } ]

3. Document about 'attachments'
   The document about 'attachments' section in shared JSON should define every possible item in a sheet, for each item, provide the definition in detail by answering these questions:
   a. what's the name of this item?
   b. what's the type of its value?
   c. Is it a MUST item in the JSON, and always be set with a value?
   d. what's the default value if it is absent from stream?
   e. MUST it show in BPC stream? or an optional item.
   f. Is it an item that allow user to Click?
   g. [optional, if Yes to f], what's the intent/Activity will be trigger when it is clicked.
   h. [optional] what's the extra comments to the item?

   Here is an example about the 'attachments' of BOOK, which only define #a and #b, which should be append #c,#d,#e,#f and possible #g, #h:
   "name": string
   "summary": string
   "coverurl": string
   "id": string

  4. Callback actvity to respond 'Open' action of the attachement
   To respond the click action that intent to open the 'attachemnts', the component privode an Activity and declare a scheme of Intent-filter in AndroidManifest.xml
   e.g. Qiupu provide activity ApkDetailInfoActivity with belowing intent-filter
    <intent-filter android:priority="100">
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:scheme="borqs"
            android:host="application"
            android:path="/details">
        </data>
    </intent-filter>
   
5. BPC activity to browse the shared stream
   BPC provide PostActivity to present stream, the available value of appId and type MUST be compatible to definition of server side. The description in detail refer to helper class BpcApiUtils.
   1. copy the code src/com/borqs/common/BpcApiUtils.java into the component project.
   2. invoke BpcApiUtils.startStreamActivityWithStreamType(Context context, int type) or startStreamActivityWithAppId(Context context, APPID appId).
   For Book, the helper type is BpcApiUtils.ONLY_BOOK_POST and BpcApiUtils.ALL_BOOK_POST.
   For Apk, the helper type is BpcApiUtils.ONLY_APK_POST and BpcApiUtils.ALL_APK_POST.
