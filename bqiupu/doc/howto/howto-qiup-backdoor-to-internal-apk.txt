To let those Apk always visible in Qiupu client, then be able to publish/backup via Borqs Cloud Service. We provide a back-door to get such goal:
a. show the Apk even if it was built into native read-only /system/ by CM.
b. show the Apk even if it did not consist any launcher icon in main menu or an Home app or Input method service.

Case 1: if there is any activity in AndroidManifest.xml, simply append the intent filter to one of your activity
<intent-filter>
<action android:name="com.borqs.qiupu.action.BORQS_ITEM"/>
<category android:name="android.intent.category.TEST" />
</intent-filter>

Case 2: if no any activity in AndroidManifest.xml, need to add a dump activity with the intent filter
<activity android:name=".DumpQiupuItem">
<intent-filter>
<action android:name="com.borqs.qiupu.action.BORQS_ITEM"/>
<category android:name="android.intent.category.TEST" />
</intent-filter>
</activity> 

To make those activity visible as Bpc plugin app shortcut for case 1, append the other intent filter to Activity that have android.intent.action.MAIN.
